# Gujarati-Text-or-Handwritten-Printed-Recognition-to-English-Audio-60-labels


## Abstract</br></br>

The current systems available in the market works on the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology.</br>
and this system can work only for the recognition of the printed character only. Most of systems available today</br>
are for identification of English characters.</br>
There is no promising system in the market for identification of handwritten characters of Gujarati language.</br>
Gujarati is the native language of Gujarat. There are many articles, vehicle number plates, name plates and history</br>
notes written in Gujarati language which are yet to be identified by machines. The main focus is on development</br>
of a system which can identify Gujarati Characters of any type handwritten or printed. This System is based on</br>
machine learning.</br>
This system has feature of translation of identified Gujarati language character into English language character.</br>
This system also has a feature of conversion of identified Gujarati text into English audio.</br></br>
